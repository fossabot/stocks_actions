# stocks_actions


#### A little demo Python project to test out Github Actions

The simple Python program pulls information about Slack's stock and has some simple tests associated with it. Some of the functionality demoed here includes: 

- Building on multiple platforms (Windows, Ubuntu, MacOs) 
- Building with different versions of Python `(2.7, 3.8)` in parallel
- Common workflows 
  - env setup
  - linting
  - building and running 
  - test executions
- PR workflows
- Usage of other workflows e.g. labelling outdated PRs
- Skipping CI when not needed with `[skip ci]`
